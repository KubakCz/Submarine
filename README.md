# Submarine

Submarine was my final project for an introductory OpenGL course. The project includes a simple interactive scene where you can control a submarine and swim alongside fish.

This project was built on top of the Common Framework for Computer Graphics Courses at FI MUNI, which means it doesnâ€™t include all the source files necessary for a full build but only the source files relevant to this project that I wrote myself. However, you can check out images and video from the project in my [portfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/211305315/OpenGL-School-Projects), or download a working build from [itch.io](https://kubak-cz.itch.io/submarine).

**Description:**
The project demonstrates basic knowledge of OpenGL and shaders. The scene contains textured objects, hundreds of (in-shader) animated fish, multiple light sources, custom underwater light attenuation, and a fog effect. The scene is made more dynamic by fish controlled through a flocking algorithm, giving them realistic movement. The submarine features a simple physics simulation with different acceleration and drag on each movement axis.

**Source files:**
- **application.\***: Main application class controlling the whole scene.
- **scripts/**
  - **flock.\***: Class controlling movement and rendering of fish.
  - **floor.\***: Class controlling rendering of infinite floor/ocean surface.
  - **helper.\***: Class with helper functions (random numbers, vector operations).
  - **light_manager.\***: Class for managing multiple light sources.
  - **loader.\***: Class for easy access to loaded assets.
  - **sub.\***: Class for simulating submarine movement and rendering.
  - **uniform_structs.hpp**: Struct definitions for data sent to shaders.
- **shaders/**
  - **fish.\***: Shaders for rendering instanced fish. The vertex shader creates a simple fish animation, and the fragment shader handles underwater light attenuation.
  - **main.\***: Shaders for rendering standard geometry. The fragment shader includes underwater light attenuation.
  - **postprocess.\***: Postprocessing shaders to create the fog effect.
  - **surface.frag**: Fragment shader without light attenuation.
